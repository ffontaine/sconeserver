SconeServer (http://www.sconemad.com)
TODO List and ideas for future development

------------------------
NEW MODULES
------------------------

* Authorisation
  Optional standalone or system password settings.
  Need to look at terminfo to disable echoing of passwords.
  Allow/deny based on source address.
  Essential for configuration console security.

* HTTP:Perl
  For running perl in process.

* Forward
  Route connections through to a specified destination.

* TFTP
  A good one to test connected UDP once implemented.

------------------------
SCONEX
------------------------

* Seamless File & MemFile operation
  To allow files to be cached in memory but read from using the regular file
  interface.

* Multithreading
  Configurable number of 'worker' threads (>= 0).
  Multiplexer dispatches events to free threads.
  Must implement required sync functions for OpenSSL.
  Exec module will have problems calling fork, one solution would be to use
  a 'surrogate' process to do the forking, linked with a pipe.

* Datagram socket support
  Need to investigate exact operation of connected UDP sockets.

* Refactor SconeScript(Arg) and framework classes.
  Arg, ArgProc, ArgObject
  Module, ModuleLoader*
  TimeDate, Version

* Docs for descriptor-stream event model, something like:

  Opened - Stream has been opened
    Ok    - Accept, opened will not be called again on this stream
    Wait  - Don't send opened event to subsequent streams yet
    End   - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Initiate close sequence for this connection
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

  Readable - Data is available to read on the connection
    Ok    - Accept
    Wait  - Don't send readable event to subsequent streams yet
    End   - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Initiate close sequence for this connection
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

  Writeable - It is possible to write data on the connection
    Ok    - Accept
    Wait  - Don't send writeable event to subsequent streams yet
    End   - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Initiate close sequence for this connection
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

  Closed - Connection is closing
    Ok    - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Wait  - Suspend closing temporarily, don't send closing 
            event to preceeding streams yet.
    End   - Suspend closing, connection should remain open.
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

* Exec/Process
  Fork from surrogate process, Fork, Exec
  (Win32) CreateProcessAsUser

* User

------------------------
HTTP
------------------------

* Standards compliant HTTP

* Improved FS synching for http/FS* classes
  Current FS system may have problems with large directory trees.

* content-encoding: (gzip,compress)

* Module chain -- tree
