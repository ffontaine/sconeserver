SconeServer (http://www.sconemad.com)
TODO List and ideas for future development

------------------------
For 0.8.0 release
------------------------

* sconex
 - Arg authority parameters

* HTTP
 - AuthRealm passwords stored in sha1

* Sconesite 
 - Article file/upload file manager object
 - Hierarchical article trees 
 - Image handler


------------------------
NEW MODULES
------------------------

* Authorisation
  Optional standalone or system password settings.
  Need to look at terminfo to disable echoing of passwords.
  Allow/deny based on source address.
  Essential for configuration console security.

* HTTP:Perl
  For running perl in process.

* TFTP
  A good one to test connected UDP once implemented.
  Started but not working very well.

------------------------
SCONEX
------------------------

* Seamless File & MemFile operation
  To allow files to be cached in memory but read from using the regular file
  interface.

* Refactor SconeScript(Arg) and framework classes.
  Arg, ArgProc, ArgObject
  Module, ModuleLoader*
  TimeDate, Version

* Docs for descriptor-stream event model, something like:

  Opened - Stream has been opened
    Ok    - Accept, opened will not be called again on this stream
    Wait  - Don't send opened event to subsequent streams yet
    End   - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Initiate close sequence for this connection
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

  Readable - Data is available to read on the connection
    Ok    - Accept
    Wait  - Don't send readable event to subsequent streams yet
    End   - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Initiate close sequence for this connection
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

  Writeable - It is possible to write data on the connection
    Ok    - Accept
    Wait  - Don't send writeable event to subsequent streams yet
    End   - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Initiate close sequence for this connection
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

  Closed - Connection is closing
    Ok    - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Close - Remove this stream from the list, no further events
    Wait  - Suspend closing temporarily, don't send closing 
            event to preceeding streams yet.
    End   - Suspend closing, connection should remain open.
    Error - Force the connection closed at earliest oppurtunity

------------------------
HTTP
------------------------

* Standards compliant HTTP

* content-encoding: (gzip,compress)

* Module chain -- tree
