SconeServer aims to be simple to build from source on most systems. There are
no pre-built binary packages available at the current time.
</p>

<h2>Installing from source on Linux or UNIX systems</h2>

<p>
First, download the latest source tarball from the 
<a href='download.html'>download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Untar to a temporary directory, then <em>cd</em> into the created directory:
</p>
<pre class='shell'>
<b>$</b> tar -xzf sconeserver-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
<b>$</b> cd sconeserver-&lt;version&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Run the <em>configure</em> script to autodetect your system settings and
generate the Makefiles:
</p>
<pre class='shell'>
<b>$</b> ./configure --prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Where &lt;prefix&gt; is the desired install location, which defaults to 
"/usr/local".
</p>

<p>
Build everything with:
</p>
<pre class='shell'>
<b>$</b> make
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you may also wish to build and run the tests with:
</p>
<pre class='shell'>
<b>$</b> make check
</pre>

<p>
Install SconeServer by doing <em>make install</em>. You will need to 
<em>su</em> to become root if you're installing to a system directory:
</p>
<pre class='shell'>
<b>$</b> su
<b>Password: </b>
<b>#</b> make install
</pre>

<p>
Make sure the directory "&lt;prefix&gt;/lib" is listed in "/etc/ld.so.conf", if
not, add it to the end, then run <em>ldconfig</em> (as root).
</p>

<p>
And that's it, SconeServer is installed and ready to run. You'll probably want
to read the section on <a href='config.html'>configuration</a> first though.
