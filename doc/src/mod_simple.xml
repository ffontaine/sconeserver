<p>
The simple module provides a set of standard simple TCP/IP services 
traditionally supported by UNIX-like systems. These are rarely used, except
for debugging purposes.
</p>


<h2>Connections</h2>

  <div class='scr-obj'>
  <h4>
  router.&lt;route-name&gt;.add (
    <span>"simple",</span>
    <span>service : <em>string</em></span>
  )
  </h4>
  </div>

<p>
A connection to the simple module will insert a protocol handler stream for
the requested service. If no service name is specified, the module will attempt
to determine the service required based on the incoming port number and the 
operating systems service mappings. If the service is not supported or not 
recognised, the connection will be dropped.
</p>
