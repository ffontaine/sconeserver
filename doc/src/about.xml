<p>
The goal of the SconeServer project is to provide a framework in which to 
develop and deploy a series of reusable modules, from which any kind of 
network server can be constructed.
</p>

<p>
A general set of modules is supplied with SconeServer - see the
<a href='modules.html'>Modules</a> page for more details. These can be
updated, removed, or added to if required. SconeServer modules are implemented
as Dynamic Shared Objects (Dynamic Link Libraries on Windows systems), so
they can be added or removed from the SconeServer without the need to
recompile. In fact they can be added, removed or updated while the server is 
running.
</p>

<p>
The SconeServer framework makes it easy for third parties to develop new
modules to extend the capabilities of the system. See the
<a href='develop.html'>Development</a> section for more information.
