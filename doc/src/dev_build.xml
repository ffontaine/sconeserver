<p>
SconeServer uses GNU Autoconf, Automake and Libtool to allow it to be easily
configured and built on a variety of platforms. This section will not attempt
to explain how these tools work, but rather how they are used within 
SconeServer. 
</p>

<h3>configure.in</h3>

<p>
This file is used to generate the <em>configure</em> script which is run to 
configure the source tree before building. It does several things:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
  Automatically determines what options should be used by examining what is
  available on the system.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  Allows the user to manually select options, which can override the above.
  </li>

  <li>
  Determines whether the system has all that is required to build properly
  with the selected options.
  </li>

  <li>
  Determines any platform-specific settings that are required, such as the
  presence and location of required header files and libraries, and put in 
  place any alternatives for facilities that are unavailable. These settings
  are output to a header called <em>config.h</em>, which can be included in 
  the source where required.
  </li>

  <li>
  Uses Automake to generate the required makefiles using the templates.
  </li>  

</ul>

<h3>Makefile.am</h3>

<p>
There is generally one of these in each subdirectory that contains files to be
built.
