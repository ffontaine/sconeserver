<p>
This section describes in detail how SconeServer works, and how it can be 
extended by writing plugin modules.
</p>

<h2>System Structure</h2>

<p>
SconeServer consists of an executable daemon <em>sconed</em>, a shared 
library <em>libsconex</em>, and a set of dynamically loaded modules:

<h3><a href="dev_sconed.html">sconed</a></h3>

<p>
The executable daemon <em>sconed</em> is responsible for starting the 
SconeServer framework and creating the root module <em>sconeserver</em>. 
</p>

<h3><a href="dev_libsconex.html">libsconex</a></h3>

<p>
The shared library <em>libsconex</em> defines and implements the many features 
that comprise the SconeServer framework, allowing the daemon and modules to 
take advantage of these, and also allowing all the components to communicate 
with each other. 
</p>

<h3><a href="dev_modules.html">Modules</a></h3>

<p>
The modules are the most important part of SconeServer, in that they are used
to communicate with the clients, and implement any required protocols.
SconeServer can be easily extended to handle new protocols or features by
writing new modules.
