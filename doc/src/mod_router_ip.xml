<p>
The ip module allows TCP/IP Version 4 socket addresses, commonly used for 
making connections over the Internet.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Only TCP (stream) socket types are supported at 
present.
</p>


<h2>SconeScript Interface</h2>

<p>
In addition to the standard module interface, it also has the following:
</p>

  <div class='scr-obj'>
  <h4>
  addr (
    <span>host : <em>string</em> , </span>
    <span>service : <em>string (or int)</em> </span>
  )
  </h4>
  <p>
  Create a socket address for the specified IP host and service.
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>host</em> can be: 
  <ul>
    <li>
    An internet host name, which will be resolved using the
    machine's resolver settings when required (usually by DNS lookup).
    </li>
    <li>
    A numeric IP address in the form "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd".
    </li>
    <li>
    An asterisk "*" - indicating a wildcard address. This is only valid when
    used with listening sockets and indicates that connections should be 
    accepted on all available local interfaces.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  <em>service</em> can be: 
  <ul>
    <li>
    The name of a standard service, which will be resolved using the
    machine's resolver settings when required (usually by lookup in the
    /etc/services file).
    </li>
    <li>
    A port number.
    </li>
  </ul>
   
  <p>
  If the address is required for listening, then <em>host</em> should specify
  a local interface (or, more commonly, "*" for all) and <em>service</em> 
  should specify a currently unused port.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that, on most systems, <em>SconeServer</em> will need to be running 
  with root privileges in order to have permission to listen on low numbered 
  ports (<1024).
