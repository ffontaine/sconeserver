<p>
libsconex provides platform-independent wrappers around some common features 
required by network servers, such as sockets and threads. This makes it very
easy to develop a module which will then compile and work successfully on all 
platforms supported by SconeServer.
</p>

<p>
More in-depth documentation covering all the useful features in libsconex 
should be available soon.
</p>

<p>
The following sections describe the various areas of functionality implemented
by sconex.
</p>

  <h3>Streams</h3>
  <p>
  Sconex defines platform-independent stream classes for file and socket I/O, 
  with a highly extensible event-driven stream pipeline system. Includes 
  standard stream classes for buffering and tokenizing. Also includes an 
  event driven stream multiplexer for managing non-blocking streams.
  </p>

  <h3>Modules and Sub-Modules</h3>
  <p>
  Sconex defines the basic module framework, which supports sub-modules using a
  DSO (dynamic shared object) plugin system. 
  </p>

  <h3>SconeScript</h3>
  <p>
  A simple object orientated scripting system for configuration and 
  inter-module communication.
  </p>

  <h3>Threading</h3>
  <p>
  Sconex supports multiple threads and synchronisation using Win32 threading or
  POSIX threads.
  </p>
